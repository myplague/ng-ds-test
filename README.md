1. Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data).

push     (add a value in the end)

pop     ( remove the last value)


2. Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data).

enqueve (para agregar data al final del elemento con this.data.push)

denqueve (para eleminar una data al principio con this.data.shift)




3. Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27

                                    30
                              15          45
                            10  20      40   50                      
                                  27
                                    29

4. Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

this tree is balanced



5. Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

                   30
            15             45
        10     27       40    50
            20    29




6. Consider the following tree:
------5
---2-----8
-1--3



Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance?

          ------5
          ---2-----8
          -1--3
         -0


7. How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))


            2
        1       5
      0       3   8




8. What are the four main steps of mergesort?



9. What are the four main steps of quicksort?

10. What is an angular directive?

Una directiva se une el comportamiento de un elemento HTML.




11. When specifying an angular directive, you write a function which must return an object called:
a. Directive Constructor
b. Fidel y Chavez Object
c. Directive Definition object
d. Directive Object      ---------------- esta



12. What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions? (Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).




13. In order to send ajax requests in Angular, the most accepted programming convention is to create an angular:
a. Module
b. Service
c. Controller
d. $http----------esta




14. In order to create a service, you must use the following angular function:
a. angularApp.controller
b. angularApp.module-------------------esta
c. angularApp.directive
d. angularApp.factory

15. Go to my angular projects github repo and do one of them. Don't clone the repository, but rather add all the files to the folder which corresponds to your github repo. Add the files right at the root of your repo, not within a subfolder. Make sure you upload it to fvi-grad.com and also to a github repository.
